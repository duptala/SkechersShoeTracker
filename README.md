**SkechersShoeTracker**

In the store I work at, the boxes for shoes is all over the store, making it difficult to efficiently retrieve shoes for a customer when they request for one. So I built a Skechers shoe tracker which essentially shows where the particular shoe is with the click of a button. You enter the code to find it, and its location of its whereabouts is highlighted. This speeds up the process of finding shoes and in turn the amount we sell, faster.
